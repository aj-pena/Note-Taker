## <Note-Taker>

## Description

This application is deployed in Heroku and it allows the user to save notes that can then be read, edited
or deleted. It will help the user keep track of tasks, events and thoughts. 

With this application I expect to learn to use the NodeJs and the ExpressJs runtime environment to simulate
requests to the server from a client-browser.
